# Code Refactoring Documentation

This document explains the refactoring approaches used to improve the Order Processing Service codebase, applying SOLID principles and design patterns.

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### Single Responsibility Principle

**Before Refactoring**: The original `OrderProcessingService` handled multiple responsibilities - database operations, API calls, file system operations, and business logic.

**After Refactoring**:
- Separated order processing logic into specialized classes:
  - `OrderProcessingService`: Orchestrates the overall process
  - `TypeAOrderProcessor`: Handles CSV file export specifically
  - `TypeBOrderProcessor`: Manages API integration
  - `TypeCOrderProcessor`: Processes flag-based orders
  - `UnknownTypeOrderProcessor`: Handles unknown order types

Each class now has a single, well-defined responsibility, making the code more maintainable and easier to test.

### Open-Closed Principle

**Before Refactoring**: Adding new order types required modifying the `OrderProcessingService` class, which involved changing existing code.

**After Refactoring**:
- Implemented the `OrderProcessorInterface` to define a standard contract
- Created the `OrderProcessorFactory` to instantiate specific processors
- Now adding new order types only requires:
  1. Creating a new processor class implementing the interface
  2. Adding a new case to the factory
  
No changes to existing code are needed, making the system open for extension but closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle

**Before Refactoring**: Different order type processing was handled with conditional logic, making substitution difficult.

**After Refactoring**:
- All processor implementations correctly implement the `OrderProcessorInterface`
- Each processor can be used interchangeably wherever the interface is expected
- The `OrderProcessingService` doesn't need to know which specific processor it's working with

### Interface Segregation Principle

**Before Refactoring**: External dependencies were directly used, coupling the code to specific implementations.

**After Refactoring**:
- Created `FileSystemInterface` with focused methods needed for file operations
- `APIClient` interface focuses only on the API-specific functionality
- No class is forced to depend on methods it doesn't use

### Dependency Inversion Principle

**Before Refactoring**: High-level modules (like `OrderProcessingService`) depended on low-level modules directly.

**After Refactoring**:
- Both high and low-level modules depend on abstractions
- `OrderProcessingService` accepts interfaces in its constructor rather than concrete implementations
- Default implementations can be provided, but custom implementations can be injected

## Factory Pattern Implementation

### Problem Addressed

The Factory Pattern was implemented to solve the problem of order type-specific processing logic. Before refactoring, this was managed through complex conditional statements, making the code difficult to maintain and extend.

### Implementation Details

1. **Factory Class**: Created `OrderProcessorFactory` responsible for creating the appropriate processor
   
   ```php
   class OrderProcessorFactory
   {
       private $fileSystem;
       private $apiClient;
       
       public function __construct(FileSystemInterface $fileSystem, APIClient $apiClient)
       {
           $this->fileSystem = $fileSystem;
           $this->apiClient = $apiClient;
       }
       
       public function createProcessor(Order $order): OrderProcessorInterface
       {
           switch ($order->type) {
               case 'A':
                   return new TypeAOrderProcessor($this->fileSystem);
               case 'B':
                   return new TypeBOrderProcessor($this->apiClient);
               case 'C':
                   return new TypeCOrderProcessor();
               default:
                   return new UnknownTypeOrderProcessor();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Processor Interface**: Defined a contract that all processors must implement

   ```php
   interface OrderProcessorInterface
   {
       public function process(Order $order, int $userId): void;
   }
   ```

3. **Implementation Classes**: Created specialized processors for each order type, adhering to the interface

### Benefits Achieved

- **Encapsulation**: Processing logic is encapsulated within specific classes
- **Maintainability**: Each processor can be modified independently
- **Testability**: Each processor can be tested in isolation
- **Extensibility**: New order types can be added by implementing the interface

## Code Structure Changes

### Directory Organization

Reorganized the codebase into a more logical structure:

```
src/
└── Classes/
    ├── OrderProcessor/       # New directory for processor implementations
    │   ├── OrderProcessorInterface.php
    │   ├── OrderProcessorFactory.php
    │   ├── TypeAOrderProcessor.php
    │   ├── TypeBOrderProcessor.php
    │   ├── TypeCOrderProcessor.php
    │   └── UnknownTypeOrderProcessor.php
    ├── APIClient.php
    ├── APIException.php
    ├── APIResponse.php
    ├── DatabaseException.php
    ├── DatabaseService.php
    ├── DefaultFileSystem.php  # New implementation
    ├── FileSystemInterface.php  # New interface
    ├── Order.php
    └── OrderProcessingService.php
```

### External Dependencies Abstraction

Created interfaces for external dependencies:

1. **File System Operations**:
   - Introduced `FileSystemInterface` to abstract file operations
   - Created `DefaultFileSystem` as the standard implementation
   - Made file operations injectable and mockable for testing

2. **API Integration**:
   - Enhanced `APIClient` to follow interface patterns
   - Made API integration testable through proper abstraction

### Testing Improvements

The refactored code structure enabled:

1. **Isolated Component Testing**: Each processor and service can be tested independently
2. **Dependency Mocking**: All external dependencies can be easily mocked
3. **Complete Coverage**: Easier to achieve high code coverage across all components

## Key Improvements Summary

1. **Maintainability**: Code is more modular and follows clear separation of concerns
2. **Extensibility**: Adding new order types or changing processing logic is straightforward
3. **Testability**: All components are designed for easy unit testing
4. **Readability**: Code logic flow is clearer with specialized classes
5. **Robustness**: Better exception handling and error management
