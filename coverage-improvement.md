# Code Coverage Improvement

This document analyzes classes with low test coverage and provides suggestions for improvement.

## Current Coverage Status

Based on the latest test run, our overall code coverage is 93.3%, which is excellent. However, two classes have 0% coverage:

1. **APIResponse**
2. **DefaultFileSystem**

## Analysis of Uncovered Classes

### 1. APIResponse Class

```php
class APIResponse
{
    public $status;
    public $data;

    public function __construct($status, Order $data)
    {
        $this->status = $status;
        $this->data = $data;
    }
}
```

**Reason for Lack of Coverage**:
- This class is only instantiated in the mock objects created in our tests.
- We're using property access rather than constructor instantiation in mocks.
- In the `mockAPIClient()` helper function, we create a mock `APIResponse` object using Mockery, but we don't test the actual implementation.

### 2. DefaultFileSystem Class

```php
class DefaultFileSystem implements FileSystemInterface
{
    public function openFile(string $filename, string $mode)
    {
        return fopen($filename, $mode);
    }

    public function writeCSV($fileHandle, array $data): void
    {
        fputcsv($fileHandle, $data);
    }

    public function closeFile($fileHandle): void
    {
        fclose($fileHandle);
    }
}
```

**Reason for Lack of Coverage**:
- We never directly test this implementation because we're always using a mock of `FileSystemInterface` in our tests.
- The default implementation is only used when no FileSystemInterface is provided to the OrderProcessingService constructor.
- Our tests always explicitly provide a mock file system, bypassing this default implementation.

## Improvement Suggestions

### For APIResponse

1. **Create Direct Tests**:
   ```php
   test('APIResponse constructor sets properties correctly', function () {
       $order = new Order(1, 'A', 100, false);
       $response = new APIResponse('success', $order);
       
       expect($response->status)->toBe('success');
       expect($response->data)->toBe($order);
   });
   ```

2. **Use Real Objects in Some Tests**:
   - Instead of always mocking APIResponse, use real instances in some tests for better coverage.
   - This would require refactoring the APIClient mock to return real APIResponse objects.

### For DefaultFileSystem

1. **Add Integration Tests**:
   - Create tests that use the real DefaultFileSystem with temporary files.
   - Verify that file operations work as expected with actual file I/O.

2. **Test OrderProcessingService with Default Implementation**:
   ```php
   test('OrderProcessingService uses DefaultFileSystem when none provided', function () {
       $service = new OrderProcessingService(
           mockDatabaseService(),
           mockAPIClient(),
           null // Don't provide a file system, so DefaultFileSystem is used
       );
       
       // Then perform operations that would use the file system
       // Verify results indicate DefaultFileSystem was used
   });
   ```

3. **Temporarily Replace Global Functions**:
   - Use a library like [PHP-Mock](https://github.com/php-mock/php-mock) to mock PHP's global functions.
   - This allows testing DefaultFileSystem without actual file operations:
   ```php
   test('DefaultFileSystem.openFile calls fopen with correct parameters', function () {
       // Setup PHP-Mock to intercept fopen calls
       $fopen = \phpmock\Mock::setup('App\Classes', 'fopen', function($filename, $mode) {
           expect($filename)->toBe('test.csv');
           expect($mode)->toBe('w');
           return 'file-handle-mock';
       });
       
       $fileSystem = new DefaultFileSystem();
       $result = $fileSystem->openFile('test.csv', 'w');
       
       expect($result)->toBe('file-handle-mock');
       $fopen->disable();
   });
   ```

## Priority for Improvement

1. **Low Priority**: Both uncovered classes are relatively simple and represent low risk areas:
   - APIResponse is a simple data container
   - DefaultFileSystem is a thin wrapper around PHP's file functions

2. **Suggested Approach**:
   - Add basic tests for APIResponse first (easiest to implement)
   - Then add DefaultFileSystem tests as time permits
   - Consider refactoring tests to use real objects where appropriate

## Expected Outcome

Implementing these suggestions should increase our code coverage to 100% or very close to it, ensuring all code paths are tested and verified.
